1. parameter file + default option. and make default small squares, or dots.
2. clipping is forgotten when changing sphere to cube or colors...
3. lighting.
4. xyz and material properties,


** Want a possiblity to change color with depth so that some atoms appear
   almost dark...

** Should have possibility to 'show only atoms of type...'

** The angles should be floats, with the possibility to input for example, phi=16.5 deg.

** reset view angle.

**  kill parent window?? what does this mean??.

** Add a whole separate panel for Modelling/View parameters, which include only the following:

	1. lighting: Intensity (positions and number for later develop.)
	2. fixed number of fixed lights, such as in the corners of a box, or 
	   at centers of factes of bounding boxes (moved away a reasonable factor)
	for the GUI this means:  radio button to trigger one or more of the lights. + a spinner box for the intensity (0-->100)%

	3. The Perspictive arguments of OpenGL. ---> meaning the fovy.


** The xyz filter should be completed. which means add correct radius for Al, O, ....


** Different rotation modes, like vis. + the trackball

** separate pan panel.

** pan: move object and eye, or just move object

** bonds both lines then cylinders

** marking atoms (select.)

** BUG: changing colors looses clip information.

** change znear and zfar to check if the sample is out of bounds.

** more intelligent spin boxes for the clipping.
